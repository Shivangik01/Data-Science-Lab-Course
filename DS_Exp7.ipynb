        "  The email dataset had uneven class distribution with 1368 spam emails and 4360 ham emails. In this experiment, I performed text analysis for separating spam email from ham. A spam classifier can potentially benefit from including the frequency of the word that appears in every email. Random Forest model outperformed CART model in terms of Accuracy and AUC. This is because Random forests consist of multiple single trees each based on a random sample of the training data. They are typically more accurate than single decision trees."
